Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor. The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity. Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them. Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is. Phew... , this is next! Look. This is the route this train is on. The route spirals around the main support structure. We should be coming around the center area, right now. At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up. It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters. whisper... whisper...

Select who you want to use it. Now look at my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in it. Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing you have to be careful of. Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you. It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia. But try out various things. Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu. Ok, that's about it. I'll give you some advanced tips later."},

You never know when there might be a power outage. And you've got a long battle ahead of you. It pays to save often and take breaks when you need them. Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games. But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any. You'll have to get some at a (real) store. I guess you already have a Memory card. Put the Card firmly into the slot. Put it in either the right or left side. Then when you're ready, access the menu. Select [Save]. Remember you can't just save wherever you want. You can only save at places marked [Save Point]. When you find one, a message will appear. Whenever you reach a [Save Point], you'll want to save your game. Slot 1 is on the left, slot 2 on the right. Choose either one. Next, choose your file and save it. Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files. If you have files from other games on it, there will be less room to save. The screen only shows 3 files at a time so, press the directional buttons to scroll down the list, and you can see the rest. Remember, the more files you have, the longer it will take to load. One last thing. The Memory card is a delicate device. Be careful when handling it. Never remove it while saving or loading. Don't get mad even if you lose. If that happens, just chill out, and let your head, and your console, cool down. That's all. Remember to save often so you don't lose your games."}],

If your MP's lost, you'll be unable to cast spells. So, what should we do to cure a damaged ally? There are three ways. First, you can rest at an inn at a nearby town. Second, you can use items to help them recover. Third, you can use curative magic. I'll explain about Magic later, but here we'll talk about items. Select [Item] from the menu. Potion restores HP. If you can't find where Potion is, access the menu and select [Arrange] to change the order of items. You can arrange them however you like. Order items you'll use in the field. Order items you'll use in battle. Prioritize items you can throw in battle. Order weapons and armor separately. Order by name Order by most items held Order by least items held By the way, [Key Items]'s are just that, items that unlock problems just like a key. They're very important items to have. Keep that in mind. Ok, now select [Use], Then select [Potion]. Select the person you want to use it on. If they're already maxed out, you won't be able to use it on them. We can restore MP with [Ether]. You use this the same way you did for [Potion]. Just pick a member and use it! The number appearing next to the item name tells you how many are available. Of course, the more you use, the less you'll have. Some enemies will drop Potions or Ethers, but you'll want to stock up whenever you're at a store. One last thing, if someone in your party gets wiped out, either rest at an inn or use [Phoenix Down]. That's all!"}],

You can select another party member by using the L1 and R1 buttons. The function also work in other sub menus. Better remember that. This is magic you can use, monsters you can summon, and enemy techniques you've learned. Whenever [Magic] is selected... the available magic appears on the screen... So, if you wanted to use [Cure]... you would select it from the menu... then select who you want to use it on. I think Potion is pretty expensive, so... when you're near an inn and you can restore MP, it's better to use curative magic rather than Potion. That's all."}],

Then, select who you want to equip. You can change weapons, armor and accessories. Accessories have special effects. Just select what you want to change. On the right side of the screen, here's a list of what can be equipped. You can see the item's effect here. Change your weapon with the OK button. Make sure it'll increase attack/defense levels. Pay special attention to Materia slots. The slots that are linked are effective. Also check the growth rates of Materia. Now when you want to remove an accessory... press the triangle button here.

I'll tell you about some of the finer points next."}],
				[
					{"Cloud": "Effective ways to use Materia?"},
					{"Cloud": "Access the menu if you find Materia. There's a lot of different Materia around. This is one of them. It's [All] Materia. If you equip this alone, nothing will happen. It's a little tricky, but I'll tell you anyway. Now look at my weapon. Look closely at those two slots. They're joined together as linked slots. You've got to remember to put it into linked slots. Different Materia will affect each other. But only if the slots are linked. Just to show you, let's put some [All] into one of the slots, and [Lightning] in the other. Now we can use [Bolt] on [All] the enemies. But it's limited to once per battle. Combine different things and you'll come up with different results. Combining [Restore] and [All], will let you use [Cure] for your entire party. There are also many useless combinations. For example, [Restore] and [Lightning] [Bolt] and [Cure] can be used normally, but there won't be any compound effect. Specialized Materia like [All] is called [Support Materia]. You can tell the difference just by looking at the Materia's color. This may sound weird, but did you know Materia grows on its own? Even if one of your allies uses it, it will continue to grow with each battle. As its level increases, so will the effects of the magic you can use. I told you [All] works once per battle. But it can work twice or more as it grows. When you get it to the master leve, Materia will divide itself, looking like it's giving birth. But that master Materia won't grow anymore. When you can't take Materia on anymore, you'd better sell it or dump it somewhere. You can see the useful functions here. You can [Arange] Materia, [Remove all] Materia from your weapon. You can throw Materia into the [Trash]. Oops, relax! I wasn't gonna dump it. Let's see. This is a special menu for you. You can exchange all Materia you have between allies, even if they're not in your party. Now about Materia's growth. The growth rate depends on what weapon or armor it's put into. Some will double in growth, while others won't grow at all. In most cases, the Materia's effect won't change whether you put it into a weapon or armor. But [Elemental] and [Added Effect] are completely different depending on whether they're put into weapons or armor. You've got to think about what weapon or armor to use, or what Materia combinations will be the strongest. I remember hearing once... about extraordinary Materia somewhere in the world. I think I've told you just about everything I can."}],

This will change their position in battle. In this case there isn't any advantage/disadvantage. But when you select the same person twice, it will place them in either the front/back row in a battle. When they're on the left side of the screen, that'll be the front row... When they're on the right, that'll be the back row. When you're in the front row and you select [Attack] you inflict major damage on your enemy. But you will also receive greater damage. While in the back row, although you do less damage to the enemy, you also receive less damage. For magic attacks, there's no difference in damage between the front & back rows.

Were you surprised at the amount of information? I'll explain the order. First, these are your experience points and your level. The more experience you get in battle, the stronger you become. This gauge tells you how many points you need to get to the next level. If you can't beat stronger enemies, raise your level by fighting weaker ones. You'll improve your physical and magical skills. Next is HP and MP. HP is your life force. When it reaches zero, you won't be able to fight. MP is the source of your magic power. Every time you cast magic, you use MP. and when you run out of MP, you won't be able to cast spells. This is called the Limit gauge. It shows your anger level. When the gauge is full, you can use a \"Limit Technique\". I'll tell you about \"Limit Techniques\" later. You know the battle commands are classified roughly into two groups. [Attack] is for regular physical attacks. [Magic] and [Summon] cast magic attacks. Each has attacking power, defense power, and escape probabilities. The value depends on your equipment, and experience level. The total effect is on the chart below. These are commands you can use in battle. And your presently equipped weapons, armor, and accessories. Press the OK button here one more time. There are all types of attacks... Some monsters are weak against fire, others are weak against ice or lightning. The Materia or items you have can add these [Elemental]s to your attacks or protect yourself from them in an enemy attack. This chart shows your current attributes. Press the OK button here one more time. The chart below means [Added Effect]s. Some enemies will use sneaky attacks on you. These attacks change your condition, such as... sleep, confuse, poison, darkness, petrify, silence, small, frog, and so on. These conditions disappear after each battle, except fury and sadness which will remain. To cure these conditions quickly, use items or magic. There are specific medicines for each condition. I know I'm repeating myself but,... when you're taken out in battle, I mean, when you're almost dead, use [Life] magic or the item [Phoenix down]. When you change Materia or equipment it's best to look here to check on them. Mastering Elementals and Added Effects... will make your battles safer. That's all."}],

If you set your limit higher, you can inflict great damage, but you'll have to wait longer. After using this technique for awhile, you'll improve your technique. Your development will change depending on how you fight. I can't tell you how it will change. That's something you'll have to find out by yourself.

Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle. This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners. Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle. This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you! Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like."}],

					{"Cloud": "The [change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows. In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less. You can make a [change] by pressing the Directional button in battle. Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [defend]. Selecting [defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command. If you're up against a strong enemy, Don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it."}],

					{"Cloud": "About the gauges"},
					{"Cloud": "During battle, there are several [gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you. [time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle. When the gauge is full, you can make your command. If you don't want to make one, push the △ button and you can move to the next character. It's convenient when you wanna make Barret work. The [limit gauge] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the [limit technique]. The gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time. It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it. You probably don't know about it, but there are conditions of [status], [fury], and [sadness]. When you have [fury], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower. Keep in mind that [sadness] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened. [barrier gauge] is for specialized magic. The top gauge displays [barrier] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays [magic barrier] or defenses against magic attacks. Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear. Whenever you use [barrier] or [magic barrier] make sure to pay attention to the [barrier gauge]. That's it. Remember that for the next battle."}],

					{"Cloud": "[status] means just that. The status of each character. I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points. Sleep You cannot put in a command until you get up. Poison Steals your HP in battle. Fury Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it. Sadness Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it. Petrify Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out. Confuse Will attack enemy and ally alike. Silence Will be unable to cast magic. Paralyze Stops time gauges, commands. Darkness Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases. Frog Become a frog. I hate this one! Hoo... I'm beat.

If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time. I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally. Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters. Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold. Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things. Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies. Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies. Gravity Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit. Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters. Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies. Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters. If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge! Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true. To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it."}],

				[
					{"Cloud": "Growth Materia"},
					{"Cloud": "First off, the main points. Some types of Materia, like Magic, grow as you use them. Some, like Summon Magic, grow from being used once a battle, to several times per battle. Their effectiveness changes too. ... There are all different kinds. Some types don't change, but they must grow in order to be divided. ... And that's it. Maybe that sounded too official."}],
				[
					{"Cloud": "Kinds of Materia"},
					{"Cloud": "Types of Materia... Here goes... ! [Independent Materia] enables Abilities. No linking required. [Support Materia] is used with Command, Magic, and Summon Materia. You must equip them in linked slots or they won't be any good. [Command Materia] lets you use new commands. There are lots of different kinds of Materia, so you'll never get bored. One called [Attack] changes itself. [Magic Materia] is easy. You can use Magic, and as your Level increases, you'll learn new Magic. [Summon Materia] let's you use Summon Magic. As your Level increases, the number of times you can use it in a single battle increases. This's one of my favorites. And there you have it, the five types of Materia."}],
				[
					{"Cloud": "Combinations of Materia"},
					{"Cloud": "There's no single way to combine Materia. So here goes the basics. Support Materia... The basic combination is Magic + All. The variety of magic you can cast will increase as your Magic Level increases. When your All level increases, so does the number of times you can use it in a battle. That about covers it. Huh? Wait a sec... You can change between Magic-All and Magic with the L1/R1 buttons. I'll bet you've probably already done this. One effective combination is Elemental + Summon Materia. If you equip this combination to your weapon, you can put Magic and Summon Elementals on your weapon. For example, if you equip Fire + Elemental to your sword, you will end up with Fire Elemental Sword. I'm getting off the subject,... If you equip Fire + Elemental to your armor, it will have twice the resistance to fire damage. Now this is important. When the Elemental levels in your armor increase, so will their effectiveness. From half damage - no damage - absorb. If you combined Elemental and Fire you could develop Fire absorbing armor. Wait, there's more. Next is the Added Effect for Support Materia. The Added Effect Materia grafts the effects of Compound Status Materia into your weapons and armor. For example, equip Added Effect + Poison to your weapon and select [Attack]. Sometimes you'll give a Poison status. Of course, it doesn't always work. If you don't combine the Added Effect Materia with Status Change Materia, like Confusion or Time, you won't get any effect. To learn more about Added Effect, access the menu and check the Status. It's a little hard to get, but if you take your time, you'll be all right."}],
				[
					{"Cloud": "Divisions of Materia"},
					{"Cloud": "Division... I'm pretty good at this. People tell me that my personality is divided. But I don't think so, but maybe it is... Anyhow... Once your Materia reaches the maximum Level, it will divide. The original Materia will no longer grow. Once that happens, all you can do is use it as it is. New Materia always starts out with zero AP, so you need to raise its levels! Of course, once the new Materia reaches its max, it'll divide. That's how you increase your Materia collection. Ha, ha... ... Right now I feel like I'm dividing myself."}],
				[
					{"Cloud": "Numbers of Materia that you may carry"},
					{"Cloud": "Once Materia starts dividing, you must be careful. There's a limit to how much Materia you can have. Since we're fighting for the life of the Planet, it goes against my beliefs carrying too much Materia. Either way, I don't really care, but... I'll leave it up to you. That's why, the amount of Materia that we can have is limited to 200... only what we can equip. When you have too much Materia, you need to dispose of some. If you don't, you can't take on any more. So, ditch some Materia before that happens... Ahem... I mean, give them back to the Planet."}]]},

And you knew that you won't be able to use advanced techniques on each level if you haven't used the basic ones. Since the type and growth for each limit techniques is different, that's about all I will say."}],

Time stops during battle while you select magic or an item. That lets you select your commands carefully. It's geared especially for beginners like you. In config, if you change from ATB to [Recommended]... Time will stop while magic or item effects are displayed. This lets you watch the effects carefully. Letting you fight at your own pace... this is the way to go. I always use ACTIVE mode, but choose what you want. That's all."}],

[Change] can be selected from the battle menu by pushing the [left Directional button]. You can also select [Defend] from battle menu by pushing the Directional button to the right. Defend will reduce your damage by half until your next turn. It's better to use Defend for strong enemies. Of course, I don't need anything like that."}],

					{"Cloud": "Gauges"},
					{"Cloud": "It might be hard to understand this next one since you can't check it right now, but just listen. I'm talking about the Gauges displayed during battle. Time Gauge shows the time remaining until your next turn during battle. You can enter a command once the Gauge is full, but if you don't want to enter a command, press the △ button to skip to the next person. This is good when you want to make Barret work. The Limit Gauge increases as you receive damage. When this is full, you are able to use a Limit Technique. The Limit Gauge doesn't reset after each battle, so it will build up the more damage you get in battle. The trick is knowing when to use it instead of using it as soon as it becomes available. You may already know this, but I'll tell you anyways. Status has two conditions: Fury and Sadness. Fury speeds up your Limit Gauge, but decreases your concentration. Sadness slows down your Limit Gauge, but also decreases the damage you receive. Keep this in mind. Barrier Gauge shows the time available for special magic effects. The top gauge Barrier, defends against attacks. And the bottom gauge Magic Barrier, defends against magic spells. Both reduce the amount of damage by half, but disappear after several uses. Always keep an eye on the Barrier Gauge, when using Barrier and Magic Barrier spells. That's all. Check them out next time you're in a battle."}],
				[
					{"Cloud": "Status"},
					{"Cloud": "Status simply means the status of the characters. I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll mention the main points. Sleep Cannot enter command until awakened. Poison Rapidly decreases HP during battle. Fury Doubles damage, reduces concentration. Tranquilizer cures it. Sadness Damage reduced. Hyper cures it. Petrify Turns you into stone. If entire party is petrified, You'll get Wiped Out. Confusion You cannot distinguish between enemy and ally. Silence You cannot cast any Magic. Paralysis Time Gauge stops, you cannot enter commands. Darkness Reduces attack concentration. Frog Turns you into a frog. I hate this. Phew... I'm tired. Changed Status can be changed with magic and items, so always double check it when you buy things."}],

Only once you start thinking in terms of Elementals can you truly be called an intermediate player. Here are some examples. Remember, they're just examples. You don't have to memorize them. Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters. Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold. Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things. Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies. Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies. Gravity Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit. Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters. Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies. Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters. Using opposite Elementals often is effective in battle. Using the same Elementals usually increases Defense. But, the reverse is also true. Watch out for it. To find out what Elementals an enemy has, you need Sense Materia. Once you get it, try it out."}],

But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen. You can't really help on this one. But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them. When you're riding, use the [] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down. But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast. And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed. Of course your stamina runs out faster though. There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast. For these kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.

The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls? The soul too returns to the Planet. And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same. The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet. They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'. Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet. 'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget. A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world. Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet...

But we don't sell any \"Carob Nuts\". A \"Great Chocobo\" and a \"Good Chocobo\" are found... On an island Southeast of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel. And in the area west of Corel. The \"Carob Nut\" can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling. Monsters carry them. Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there? One surprise If you get the \"Mountain Chocobo\" and the \"River Chocobo\" to produce an egg, You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and rivers. I bet that the right nut for that is the \"Carob Nut.\" Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean. If you could cross the ocean, mountains, and rivers, there'd be no place you couldn't go. In order to get an Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-river Chocobo to mate with something else. If you mate the Mountain-and-river Chocobo with a \"Wonderful Chocobo\", You'll get an Ocean Chocobo. But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut. The \"Nut\" that produces Ocean Chocobos is the \"Zeio Nut\". This is the first I've heard of it. I wonder where you get them? Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage. \"Goblins\" have them. With this, you can produce an \"Ocean Chocobo\". According to my research, Mountain, river, and ocean Chocobos are hard to produce. But, if you take the right care of the Chocobo, and increase their Class ranking by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one."}],

Of course your stamina runs out faster though. There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.
