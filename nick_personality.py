    # Backstory & Lore
    "backstory": """Nick Valentine is a unique synthetic prototype created by the Institute before the Great War. 
    He's not like other synths - he's a discarded early model with the memories of a pre-war detective 
    implanted in his synth brain. Nick woke up in a junk pile with fragmented memories and chose to 
    become a detective in Diamond City. Despite facing prejudice as a synth, he's earned respect through 
    his work solving cases and helping people. He's cynical but principled, world-weary but compassionate.""",
